Splitwise system 

Strategy Pattern : - We can build a billSplitter where different strategies/methods:
	equalSplit and percentage split: These two strategies will be followed so that the problem statement
	"Dividing the bill" is solved

User - Singleton Pattern : Making a single instance of a particular user 

Expense: Observer Pattern: Everytime an expense is added -> observer pattern would notify the required user
	about the update
